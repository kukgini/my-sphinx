Failed to push java app (case sensative entries)
================================================================================
Case Sensative 한 entries 가 포함된 jar 를 Case Insensative 한 FileSystem 을 가진 OS (예: MacOS X, Windows)
에서 push 하면 오류가 발생한다. 다음은 Slack 에 문의했던 내용을 기초로 제출한 GitHub Issue (https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/issues/1147) 이다 

  When I push app for java_buildpack. i got this message:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ cf push
    Using manifest file .../manifest.yml

    Updating app <appname> in org <orgname> / space <spacename> as <appname>...
    OK

    FAILED
    Error processing app files: mkdir /var/folders/51/r9kh5s8s6s.../T/unzipped-app006450987/META-INF/license: not a directory
    ```

    There is case sensitive entries like this:
    ```
    META-INF/LICENSE (which is file) 
    META-INF/license/ 
    META-INF/license/license-file-1.txt
    META-INF/license/license-file-2.txt 
  
  I am a MacOS X User (and sometimes use Windows of course). 
  It seems like cf cli try to extract jar entries into /var/ before push it. 
  But, MacOS default file system is case insensitive.

  Sometimes, I can't manipulate jar entries because it is auto generated by build system (like gradle).
  So, It's better not extracting files from jar.
